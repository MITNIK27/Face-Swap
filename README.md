# Image Manipulation: Face Swap and Background Swap

This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate simple image manipulation techniques: face swapping and background swapping. The first script swaps the face from one image onto another, while the second replaces the background of an image with a different one.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Mediapipe (for face swapping)
- rembg (for background removal)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy mediapipe rembg
